Ramadan Points is a web application designed to assist Muslims in observing their religious duties during the holy month of Ramadan. Our platform aims to facilitate timely prayers, recitation of Duas, and reading of the Quran on a daily basis. Users are presented with missions to accomplish, such as reading one Juz per day, praying on time, and reading Duas. Upon completing missions, users earn points and can compete with others through a leaderboard feature.

## Features

- **Points System**: Earn points by completing missions and track your progress.
- **Leaderboard**: Compete with other users and view your ranking on the leaderboard.
- **Quran Section**: Access a collection of surahs of the Holy Quran and listen to recitations of famous reciters.
